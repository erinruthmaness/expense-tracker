### This project was created while following along with Maxilimilian Schwarzmüller's *React - The Complete Guide* course on **[udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)**.  

The course was luckily being sold at an 80% discount, and I've been in sore need of a trustworthy source where I could review what I learned two years ago about React (after having used it professionally for just over a year) and really make sure I'm using the most recent technologies and the correct terminology.

Though I will be crafting this app as I follow along with the udemy instructor, I know myself well enough to predict that I'll be putting my own spin on the project wherever I can.  I suspect based on his initial walkthrough of his final product that he will use Bootstrap for all his CSS, which will also be an exciting review for me (as I've stubbornly only written custom CSS for nearly two years!)

Sidenote: I was only about half an hour into the review portion of this course when I went ahead and purchased courses on Angular, Vue, and "Clean Code" (ie best practices) from the same instructor.  Watch this space, because I'm about to go buckwild practicing new skills!
